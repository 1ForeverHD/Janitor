# Janitor
Janitor library.

[Original](https://github.com/RoStrap/Events/blob/master/Janitor.lua) was made by [Validark](https://github.com/Validark), however he doesn't really maintain that version anymore. It does have all the [original documentation](https://rostrap.github.io/Libraries/Events/Janitor/) for it though.

[Now on roblox-ts!](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/janitor)
